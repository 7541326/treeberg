They also automated logging in, exploiting the OAuth2, and due to how the washing machines worked (having to manually start the machines yourself), there was no real danger to this method. This exploit was actually reported 5 months to Cybersecurity, however, these reports were ignored.</p>

The staff made posts for cheaters to come forward and confess on their own for a more lenient punishment, but this was probably because the MOSS system couldn’t actually detect everyone despite how great they made MOSS seem. There were about 200 unique views on a previous student's repository on GitHub, and looking at that code was an unapproved resource highlighted in the course syllabus and under the academic honor policy.</p>
